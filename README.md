# Quantum-Chess

A projected which started in 2016/2017. My first programming project written in visual basic, a chess game with additional features that try to mimic quantum mechanics. This project has been writted in OOP.

This chess game also includes standard rules, except for like 'en ppasent'.

Controls:
  - left click to move
  - right click to select piece a piece to go into quantum state

# Superposition
[superpositioned_state](https://github.com/s5003597/Quantum-Chess/blob/master/images/super%20position.PNG)
Every piece on the table can go into a super position state except the Pawns. A superposition state can be set by the user (by right clicking on the piece you want to duplicate), superposition only works in valid positions that a normal piece would move in. Once a piece is in a superpositioned state, it cannot be moved until measured. Once a piece is in a superpositioned state it becomes entangled with the original piece.

# Measurement

Measurement will take place by the opponent's choice, there will be a 50/50 chance the piece will destruct or stay. If either of the superpositioned state pieced destructed, they will both disappear, else the piece that is being challenged stays, the piece becomes disentangled any 

# To Do List
  1. Indicate when user has won
  2. Implement the score function
  3. Create a menu
  4. Add feature to save game and load
  5. Multiplayer?
  6. Add posibility to change control settings
  7. Adjust quantum rules to mimic the mechanics more closely
  8. Better GUI
